I have attached my code for deliverable 3 as a test file. I know it is incomplete and incorrect, as is the rest of this challenge, but I am doing this in the spirit of seeking some direction and also showing what I have tried to do for the challenge. For some reason this jupyter notebook files did not add to the git hub repo.

I had problems with this challenge and module from the start. The directions were very difficult to follow and often cofusing and redundant,  and there was so much information that I had a hard time keeping names of data sets, dfs, etc. straight. I copied things right from the module and was still unable to get them to run. I feel this is one of the most important of all the skills in the course, but there was just way too much to absorb in this module. I know this challenge is imcomplete and incorrect, but I got help from tutors, office hours and learning assistants in the process. In the end, I just have to cut my losses and move on to Module 9. Please give me feedback that will help me get on track and I will revisit this in the coming weeks when I have time. 

I could not include the data sets in a resources file as the CSV file included is much too large and will not upload. I was told by TAs and instructors that graders have the files and it is not a problem, however, it did create a problem with my repo. 

Thank you.
